# Thesis Analysis – R Scripts & Survey Data Processing

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis workflows used in my master’s thesis, covering both:

1. **Fitbit data analysis** – conducted in R (see `R_scripts` folder) with corresponding outputs stored in the `outputs` folder.
2. **Survey data analysis** – processed in Excel (see `Excel` folder).

The purpose of this repository is to provide **transparency in methods** and allow others to review the analytical process.


## Data Privacy

All raw data, including fully anonymised survey responses, has been **intentionally excluded** from this repository to comply with GDPR and ensure participant privacy. Only aggregated and processed outputs are included.



## Repository Structure

### 1. Fitbit Data Analysis

* **Folder:** `R scripts and outputs` – Contains all R scripts used for statistical analysis and visualisation, as well as the obtained plots and tables (in csv form).

### 2. Survey Data Analysis

* **Folder:** `Excel` – Contains:

  * `Survey Data Analysis.xlsx` – Processing and aggregation of survey results.
  * `Tables Data Analysis Overview.xlsx` – Final formatted tables exactly as presented in the thesis. This document also contains the **citations for all R packages used**.



## Notes

* All code is provided under a permissive license (MIT) to allow reuse, modification, and sharing.
* Data is excluded to protect privacy, but the full analytical workflow remains reproducible with equivalent structured data.
